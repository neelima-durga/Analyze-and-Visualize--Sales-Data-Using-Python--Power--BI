DESCRIPTION:
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sales data using Python and Power BI as part of a Data Analytics Internship. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from raw sales data and present them through interactive dashboards. Using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the data was cleaned, processed, and analyzed to identify trends such as top-selling products, sales by region, and customer preferences. The insights were then visualized using Power BI dashboards, making the data easy to interpret for decision-making. This project enhances skills in data analysis, visualization, and reporting, while also serving as a portfolio-ready demonstration of real-world analytics.
